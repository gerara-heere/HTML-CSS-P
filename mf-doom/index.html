    <h2 id="part-one">Chorus One</h2>
    <p>Rap snitches, telling all their business</br>
        Sit in the court and be their own star witness</br>
        Do you see the perpetrator? Yeah, I'm right here</br>
        Fuck around, get the whole label sent up for years, uh</br>
        Rap snitches, telling all their business</br>
        Sit in the court and be their own star witness</br>
        Do you see the perpetrator? Yeah, I'm right here</br>
        Fuck around, get the whole label sent up for years</p>
    <h2 id="part-two">Mr. Fantastik's Part</h2>
    <p>Type profile low, like A in "Paid in Full"</br>
        Attract heavy cash 'cause the game's centrifugal</br>
        Mr. Fantastik, long dough like elastic</br>
        Guard my life with twin Glocks that's made out of plastic</br>
        Can't stand a brown-nosing nigga, fake ass bastard</br>
        Admiring my style, tour bus through Manhattan</br>
        Plotting, plan the quickest, my flow's the sickest</br>
        My hoes be the thickest, my 'dro the stickiest</br>
        Street nigga, stamped and bonafide</br>
        When beef jump niggas come get me 'cause they know I ride</br>
        True to the ski mask, New York's my origin</br>
        Play a fake gangsta like a old accordion</br>
        According to him, when the D's rushed in</br>
        Complication from the wire testimony was thin</br>
        Caused his man to go up north, the ball hit 'em again</br>
        Lame rap snitch nigga even told on the Mexican</p>
    <h2 id="part-three">Chorus Two</h2>
    <p>Rap snitches, telling all their business</br>
        Sit in the court and be their own star witness</br>
        Do you see the perpetrator? Yeah, I'm right here</br>
        Fuck around, get the whole label sent up for years</br>
        Rap snitches, telling all their business</br>
        Sit in the court and be their own star witness</br>
        Do you see the perpetrator? Yeah, I'm right here</br>
        Fuck around, get the whole label sent up for years</p>
    <h2 id="part-four">MF DOOM's Part</h2>
    <p>True, there's rules to this shit, fools dare care</br>
        Everybody wanna rule the world with tears for fear</br>
        Yeah, yeah, tell 'em, tell it on the mountain hill</br>
        Running up they mouth bill, everybody doubting still</br>
        Informer, keep it up and get tested</br>
        Pop through your bubble vest or double-breasted</br>
        "He keep a lab down south in the little beast"</br>
        So much heat you woulda thought it was the Middle East</br>
        A little grease always keeps the wheels a-spinning</br>
        Like sitting on 23's to get the squealers grinning</br>
        Hitting on many trees, feel real linen</br>
        Spitting on enemies, get the steel for tin men</br>
        Where no brains but gum flap</br>
        He said his gun clap, then he fled after one slap (pap!)</br>
        Son, shut your trap, save it for the bitches</br>
        Mmm, delicious, rap snitch kisses</p>
    <h2 id="part-five">Coda</h2>
    <p>You know what I'm saying? (It's terrible)</br>
        Crazy, man, I'm just analyzing this whole game</br>
        This is bugged out, man, niggas is snitching</br>
        Telling on they own self (it's a horror, yo)</br>
        Fuck around and get everybody bagged, man</br>
        (Atrocities) fuck around and get yo' mama bagged, nigga</br>
        You know your grandmama used to be bootlegging</br>
        Fake hustling nigga, heheheheheheh, haha</br>
        Perpetrator? Yeah, I'm right here</p>
